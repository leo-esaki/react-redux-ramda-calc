# To do
- Add animations with ReactCSSTransitionGroup.
- cursor:pointer for remove-calculation button.
- Small screens (iPhone size) should show the keypad and input only, not the previous calculations.
- ~~Move input box to the top (thanks @demestav).~~
- ~~Extract calculation item into Calculation component.~~
- ~~Refactor configuration settings (such as author, repo URL) into an easy to edit file. Store the settings into Redux store for easy access within the components.~~
- ~~Refactor the application of styles. Currently styles are in multiple places. Consider moving to a single place, or modularize everywhere. Remove Radium if not used.~~
- ~~Test on smaller screens.~~
- ~~Twitter button.~~
- ~~Sidebar with calculator buttons.~~
- ~~100% test coverage~~
- ~~Calculate and show the result while typing.~~
- ~~Use PureRenderMixin~~
- ~~Dashes next to each calculation; onClick, delete the calculation.~~
- ~~Scroll to bottom after inserting a calculation.~~
- ~~Show error when input is invalid.~~
- ~~Finalize styles and layout.~~
- ~~Should focus input on Calculate.componentDidUpdate.~~
- ~~Add `<ThemeSelector>` buttons~~
- ~~Add a light theme.~~
- ~~DRY tests with helpers.~~
- ~~Performance profile with Chrome devTools and [http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/perf.html](http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/perf.html).~~
- ~~Refactor styling to not use Radium.~~
